<h3>What are hydrocarbons???</h3>
<h4>A hydrocarbons is an organic compound consisting only hydrogen and carbon atoms (you can tell from the name). They are group 14 hybrids, which means they contain hydrogen, as well as atoms of the carbon 14 group; carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb).Another type of hydrocarbons are aromatic hydrocarbons, which include alkanes, cycloalkanes, and alkyne-based compounds. Hydrocarbons can form more complex compounds, like cyclohexane, by bonding to themselves. This is known as catenation.</h4>

<p><ul>Common hydrocarbons include:
<li>Methane(CH<sub>4</sub>)</li>
<li>Ethane(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)</li>
<li>Propane(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)</li>
<li>Butane(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>)</li>
<li>Pentane(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>)</li>
<li>Hexane(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where are they commonly found<h3>
<h4>In crude oils, coal, nautral gas and other important energy sources. As crude oil made of organic matter, it consits hydrogen and carbon bond atoms. They are also found in many plants as plants are organic. Hydrocarbons are the most widely used organic compound on the planet, and the main component of VOC(Volatile Organic Content).
The larger the hydrocarbons, the thicker the compound.</h4>

<h4>Us humans in this modern world and industrial age have manufactured many cool things like games and televisons, but do we ever check that emissions as well as pollutions created by humans are hurting the environment,thinking that the smoke and pollutions are fying off into the atmosphere, making a big ozone layer? Hydrocarbons are a big part of the polluting as studies have shown that global levels of ethane and propane in the atmosphere have been underestimated by more than 50 percent. These hydrocarbons are particularly harmful in large cities, having there be plenty of cars, reacting to become ozone layer's dinner. By <u>their own</u>, hydrocarbons have no risk. But if it is exposed to the sun or nitrogen oxides, they go into a chemical reaction. It is also a fact that the greenhouse gases coming form most crude oils, natural gases and pesticides come from hydrocarbons, and depletion of the ozone layer. The most well-known and dangerous of hydrocarbons is oil spills. This includes ship oil spills.</h4>

<h3>Do you think that sponges and hydrocarbons link? Read on to see.</h3>

<h4>With flexible and rigid types being roughly equal in market size, over three quarters of the global consumption of polyurethane products is in the form of foams. Flexible foams are behind upholstery fabrics in commercial and domestic furniture; rigid foams are between metal, or plastic walls/sheets of most refrigerators and freezers, or other surface materials in the case of thermal insulation panels in the construction sector, in both cases, the foam is usually behind other materials. An example for the use in garments growing is in lining the cups of brassieres. Polyurethane is also used for moldings which include door frames, columns, balusters, window headers, pediments, medallions and rosettes. The ability for the polyurethanes to be turned into foam is one of the most desirable attributes of polyurethane. Making a foam needs the formation of a gas at the same time as the urethane polymerization (gelation) is occurring. The gas can be carbon dioxide, either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it can also be produced by boiling volatile liquids. In the latter case heat generated by the polymerization causes the liquids to vaporize. The liquids can be HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane) and HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), and hydrocarbons such as n-pentane. So yes, sponges link with hydroccarbons.</h4>

<h3>Death causes</h3>

<h4>Like all things, hydrocarbons can be in any state of matter. If a large amount inhaled, it can cause death because the thing that causes lung irritation, with coughing, choking, shortness of breath, and neurologic problems is swallowing or inhaling hydrocarbons. Causing irregular heartbeats, rapid heart rate, or sudden death, particularly after exertion or stress is due to smelling or breathing fumes. You can get a pneumonia-like condition; irreversible, permanent lung damage; and even death is possible. When you drink hydrocarbon and it gets into the stomach, it usually passes through the body with little more than burping, feeling nauseated and a bit of diarrhea. Like this, 4.5 million people die from this every year.</h4>

<h3>Did you know that petrol and petroluem is composed of hydrocarbons?</h3>

<h4>This is the percentage that hydrocarbons have grown into our lives</h4>

<h3 style="color:#FF0000";>Instead of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon), we should consider flurocarbons (fluoride and carbon) which is more friendly to the environment then hydrocarbons.</h3>

<h4>Fluoroalkanes are mostly dormant and non-toxic.
As they contain no chlorine or bromine atoms, and they are sometimes used as replacements for ozone-depleting chemicals, fluoroalkanes are not ozone depleting. The term fluorocarbon is used rather loosely to include any chemical containing fluorine and carbon, including chlorofluorocarbons, which are ozone depleting. Fluoroalkanes are sometimes confused with fluorosurfactants, which significantly bioaccumulate. Fluorocarbons are not as dangerous.<h4>

<h3>Another solution is hydrofluorocarbons which is composed of hydrogen(H), fluorine(F) and carbon(C).</h3>

<h3>The amount of green cooling liquids used is significantly lower as that of a similar system with classic cooling by hydrofluorocarbons(HFCs), due to their superior performance. R290 and R170 are both on the SNAP list for usage in very low temperature instruments, due to these advantages.</h3>
