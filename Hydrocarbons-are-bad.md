<h3>What are hydrocarbons???</h3>
<h4>A hydrocarbons is an organic compound consisting only hydrogen and carbon atoms (you can tell from the name). They are group 14 hybrids, which means they contain hydrogen, as well as atoms of the carbon 14 group; carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb).Another type of hydrocarbons are aromatic hydrocarbons, which include alkanes, cycloalkanes, and alkyne-based compounds. Hydrocarbons can form more complex compounds, like cyclohexane, by bonding to themselves. This is known as catenation.</h4>

<p><ul>Common hydrocarbons include:
<li>Methane(CH<sub>4</sub>)</li>
<li>Ethane(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)</li>
<li>Propane(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)</li>
<li>Butane(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>)</li>
<li>Pentane(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>)</li>
<li>Hexane(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where are they commonly found<h3>
<h4>in crude oils, coal, nautral gas and other important energy sources.. As crude oil made of organic matter, it consits hydrogen and carbon bond atoms. They are also found in many plants as plants are organic. Hydrocarbons are the most widely used organic compound on the planet, and the main component of VOC(Volatile Organic Content).
The larger the hydrocarbons, the thicker the compound.</h4>

<h4>Us humans in this modern world and industrial age have manufactured many cool things like games and televisons, but do we ever check that emissions as well as pollutions created by humans are hurting the environment,thinking that the smoke and pollutions are fying off into the atmosphere, making a big ozone layer? Hydrocarbons are a big part of the polluting as studies have shown that global levels of ethane and propane in the atmosphere have been underestimated by more than 50 percent. These hydrocarbons are particularly harmful in large cities, having there be plenty of cars, reacting to become ozone layer's dinner. By <u>their own</u>, hydrocarbons have no risk. But if it is exposed to the sun or nitrogen oxides, they go into a chemical reaction. It is also a fact that the greenhouse gases coming form most crude oils, natural gases and pesticides come from hydrocarbons, and depletion of the ozone layer. The most well-know and dangerous of hydrocarbons is oil spills. This includes ship oil spills.</h4>

<h3 style="color:#FF0000";>Instead of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon), we should consider flurocarbons (fluoride and carbon) which is more friendly to the environment then hydrocarbons.</h3>

<h4>Fluoroalkanes are mostly dormant and non-toxic.
As they contain no chlorine or bromine atoms, and they are sometimes used as replacements for ozone-depleting chemicals, fluoroalkanes are not ozone depleting. The term fluorocarbon is used rather loosely to include any chemical containing fluorine and carbon, including chlorofluorocarbons, which are ozone depleting. Fluoroalkanes are sometimes confused with fluorosurfactants, which significantly bioaccumulate.<h4>
